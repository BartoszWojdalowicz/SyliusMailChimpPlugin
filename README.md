# Installation

----

```bash
$ composer require bitbag/mailchimp-plugin
```

Add plugin dependencies to your `config/bundles.php` file:
```php
return [
    ...

    BitBag\SyliusMailChimpPlugin\BitBagSyliusMailChimpPlugin::class => ['all' => true],
];
```

Import routing **on top** of your `config/routes.yaml` file:
```yaml
# config/routes.yaml

bitbag_sylius_mailchimp_plugin:
    resource: "@BitBagSyliusMailChimpPlugin/Resources/config/routing.yml"
```

Configure MailChimp credentials
```yaml
# .env

...
MAIL_CHIMP_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY

MAIL_CHIMP_LIST_ID=YOUR_LIST_ID

```

Include the newsletter in your template:
```twig
{% include '@BitBagSyliusMailChimpPlugin/_subscribe.html.twig' %}
```

Install the assets
```bash
$ bin/console assets:install --symlink
```

Add these javascripts to the layout template that includes your subscription form imported in the previous steps
```html
<script src="{{ asset(path) }}"></script>
<script src="{{ asset('bundles/bitbagsyliusmailchimpplugin/bitbag-mailchimp-plugin-newsletter.js') }}"></script>
<script>
    $('#footer-newsletter-form').joinNewsletter();
</script>
```

That's the simplest and fastest way to integrate the jQuery plugin. If you need to customize it, simply take a look at
[bitbag-mailchimp-plugin-newsletter.js](src/Resources/public/bitbag-mailchimp-plugin-newsletter.js), create your own `*.js` plugin and
import it in your main `Gulpfile.js`.
